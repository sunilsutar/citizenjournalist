Project Name :: Citizen Journalist 

Description ::
==============

This application is for social cause where any citizen will be able to upload any news or incident which is happening in front of his/her eyes.
Using the Server's API that we implemented, citizen can upload the news in the form of Images, Videos and text messages.
The subscribers of this Server will able to review it at the same instant. 

Future Plan: On this server, a process will run with some configurable time interval (e.g. an hour) which will send all the news (WITH WATERMARK).
These news are updated within last hour (specified interval) to the listed subscribers (specifically news channels e.g. timesofindia,aajtak,ndtv,CNN etc).
Get the request from any subscribers for approval to publish/BROADCAST on their specific channel or newspaper/site.
With approval, will update the requested subscriber with authenticated copy of news, which allows subscribers to publish news on their channel/newspaper/site.
